**Exhibition Curator Project**

A viewer driven virtual exhibition platform that allows users to explore artworks from world-renowned museums and curate a personalised exhibition during their session.

This project was built as part of the Tech Returners Launchpad – Exhibition Curator Project for the Software Engineering Skills Bootcamp.

**Live Demo**

Live site:
https://exhibition-curator-project.netlify.app

**Project Overview**

Users can search for artworks across multiple museum collections, view detailed information and images and curate a personal exhibition that persists for the duration of their session.

The application brings together data from multiple public museum APIs to support researchers, students, and art enthusiasts in discovering and comparing artworks across institutions.

**Key Features**

Search artworks using keywords

Aggregated results from multiple museum APIs

Artwork thumbnails with detailed modal views

Curate a personal exhibition

Add artworks to exhibition

Slideshow view of curated exhibition

External links to official museum catalogue pages

Accessibility-aware UI (ARIA roles, screen reader support)

Fully responsive design

**APIs Used**

This project uses two free public museum APIs, satisfying the Launchpad requirement:

The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API

Victoria and Albert Museum (V&A) API

All APIs used are free and do not require paid tiers.

**Tech Stack**

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Context API (state management)

Vite (build tooling)

**Accessibility Considerations**

Semantic HTML landmarks

ARIA roles for dialogs and live regions

Screen-reader announcements for loading and search status

Keyboard-accessible controls

Clear visual focus indicators

Accessibility was considered throughout the UI and interaction design.
